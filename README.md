# 3D Graphics Software Renderer
## My Summer 2019 Software Engineering Internship Project at AMD

**Utilized**: C programming, 3D graphics algorithms

A simplified version of a 3D graphics API like OpenGL, with some 3D modeling application functionalities. Designed and built during my summer internship at AMD under the mentorship of Mac 3D Graphics Driver Director Chris Bentley.

## Implemented Features
### Basic Features
* frame and filled triangle modes
* alpha blending
* depth testing
* texture mapping
* cube mapping
* bump mapping
* frustum culling
* triangle clipping

### Rendering Optimizations
* deferred rendering
* backface culling

### Additional Visual Effects
* fog
* depth of field
* post processing

### 3D Modeling Features
* scene files
* mouse IO
* object manipulators
* visible axes and bounding boxes for editing
* camera movement
